# arbeitsverwaltung_api
A simple API made with express in NodeJS just because I'm learning how to build APIs properly and don't want to suffer the endless void of API frameworks out there that are so oriented towards site hosting instead of just APIs.

Enjoy this mess from a beginner.

***

## Introduction

Before starting the server, make sure an empty db folder is present and run `npm install`. Then create a config.env file in the config folder and place all the necessary variables there (notably PORT, SECRET, ACCESS_TOKEN_LIFE and REFRESH_TOKEN_LIFE). Then run `npm run start` to launch the server.

This API always sends out responses in JSON format and also expects POST requests with JSON in the request bodies (unless specified). By default, unrouted paths would always return a 404.

In the usage section below, routes are denoted firstly by the HTTP verb (like GET, POST, PUT), then followed by the path. POST requests have the 'expects' part, which only contain the required properties of the JSON object to be sent in with the POST request. Any other property would be ignored. For example, if a POST route expects *"email: string, password: string"*, then the JSON object attached with the request should be : 

```
{
    "email": "test@example.com",
    "password": "password"
}
```

Some routes require authorization via the 'Authorization' header. This can be denoted with *(auth)* at the end of the route name listed below. These routes require an access token in the 'Authorization' header of the request to be processed.

A failed/error response should always have a status code other than 200 and be in this format :

```
{
    "error": [error message]
}
```
